# Diet vs Mortality vs GDP â€“ Tableau Analysis

## Overview
This Tableau project explores the relationship between **dietary patterns, mortality rates, and GDP** across countries. It highlights disparities between **developed** and **underdeveloped nations** and demonstrates how these differences impact **nutrition and health outcomes**.



## Key Insights
- **Dietary Patterns**
  - Underdeveloped nations: High consumption of **fruits, grains, and vegetables**.
  - Developed nations: High consumption of **protein- and fat-rich foods**, leading to overnutrition and obesity.
  
- **GDP & Nutrition Correlation**
  - Higher GDP is associated with **fat-rich diets** and higher obesity rates.
  - Lower GDP correlates with **undernutrition**, stunting, and wasting.

- **Mortality Impact**
  - Poor nutrition (both overnutrition and undernutrition) directly influences **mortality rates and life expectancy**.



## Dataset
- **Source:** WHO, FAO, and World Bank datasets on nutrition, GDP, and health indicators.
- **Scope:**
  - Macronutrient consumption (fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, fats).
  - GDP per capita.
  - Mortality rates (child/adult).
  - Malnutrition metrics (stunting, wasting, obesity).



## Tableau Visualizations
1. **Global Map:** GDP vs diet composition by country.
2. **Bar/Pie Charts:** Comparison of dietary proportions between developed and underdeveloped nations.
3. **Scatter Plots:** GDP vs obesity; GDP vs stunting/wasting.
4. **Trend Analysis:** Mortality rates vs dietary patterns over time.



## Tools & Skills Used
- **Tableau:** Dashboard design and storytelling.
- **Data Analysis:** Correlation between economic and nutritional indicators.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Comparative charts and interactive dashboards.



## Project Objective
To analyze how **economic development shapes dietary habits** and how these habits contribute to **global health outcomes**. Insights can help inform **public health strategies and policy decisions**.
